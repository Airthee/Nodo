# Dependency Management with Bun

This project uses **Bun** as its package manager and runtime.

- **Install dependencies**: `bun install` (not `npm install` or `yarn`)
- **Add a dependency**: `bun add <package>`
- **Add a devDependency**: `bun add -d <package>`
- **Run a script**: `bun run <script>` or `bun <script>` (e.g. `bun start`, `bun run lint`)

When suggesting or executing commands for installation, adding packages, or running scripts, always use Bun.
