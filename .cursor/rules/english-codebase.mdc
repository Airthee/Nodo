# English-only codebase

- **Comments**: Write all comments in English (in code, configs, workflows, docs).
- **Strings / UI text**: User-facing or log messages should be in English unless explicitly localized.
- **Documentation**: README, docs, and inline explanations must be in English.
- **Naming**: Prefer English for variable names, function names, commit messages, and branch names.

When adding or editing code, keep the entire codebase consistent in English.
